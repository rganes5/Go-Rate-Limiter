# Go-Rate-Limiter
A simple example of rate limiting using a batch processing approach.
This code demonstrates a basic client-server interaction using Goroutines and TCP communication.
The client sends requests, and the server processes them while limiting the number of concurrent connections. The server also includes a simulated delay to illustrate a scenario where it takes time to process each request.
